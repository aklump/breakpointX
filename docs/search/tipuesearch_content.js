It also allows for CSS classes to be applied to designated elements which reflect the current breakpoint.  It can be used when you need to do anything in Javascript based on window resizing.  The server-side component is useful if you're using a PHP-based CMS for coordinating breakpoints.  A breakpoint is defined as a single point along the horizontal axis.  Breakpoints themselves do not have width, but the span between two breakpoints has width.  Given a single breakpoint at 768px, the horizontal axis is broken into two spans: 0 to 767 and 768 to infinity.  The first span has a width of 767 pixels and the second has a width of infinity.

Usage  Create a new instance, define breakpoints  \/\/ Register three breakpoints that indicate these spans along the horizontal axis: \/\/ - 0px - 239px \/\/ - 240px - 767px \/\/ - 768px + var bp = new BreakpointX([0, 240, 768]);   Find the breakpoint by a horizontal, x value.  var alias = bp.alias(240); \/\/ alias === '(min-width:240px) and (max-width: 767px)';  var alias = bp.alias(200); \/\/ alias === 'max-width: 239px';  var alias = bp.alias(300); \/\/ alias === '(min-width:240px) and (max-width: 767px)';  var alias = bp.alias(1080); \/\/ alias === 'min-width: 768px';   Register a callback to fire  \/\/ When the window crosses 768 getting smaller bp.add('smaller', ['(min-width:240px) and (max-width: 767px)'], function () {   console.log('Now you\\'re in (min-width:240px) and (max-width: 767px)!'); });  \/\/ When the window crosses 768 getting bigger bp.add('bigger', ['(min-width:240px) and (max-width: 767px)'], function () {   console.log('Now you\\'re in (min-width:240px) and (max-width: 767px)!'); });  \/\/ When the window crosses any breakpoint in either direction bp.add('both', bp.aliases, function (from, to, direction) {   console.log('Now you\\'re in: ' + to.name);   console.log('Window just got ' + direction); });   Alternative: Create a new instance with named aliases  var bp = new BreakpointX([{small: 0, medium: 240, large: 768}]);   Add a class to an element reflecting the current breakpoint  var bp = new BreakpointX([{mobile: 0, desktop: 768}], {   addClassesTo: 'body' });   The body element will look like this when the browser gets larger and crosses 768px.  &lt;body class=\"bpx-desktop bpx-bigger\"&gt;   PHP  For PHP usage the namespace AKlump\\\\BreakpointX should map to node_modules\/@aklump\/breakpointx\/dist.  Here's an example for composer.json.  {     \"autoload\": {         \"psr-4\": {             \"AKlump\\\\BreakpointX\\\\\": \"node_modules\/@aklump\/breakpointx\/dist\"         }     } }  ","tags":"","url":"README.html"},{"title":"Search Results","text":" ","tags":"","url":"search--results.html"}]};
