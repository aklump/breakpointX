# Breakpoint X (Crossing)

![Breakpoint X](images/breakpoint-x.jpg)

## Summary

This project provides a means to define horizontal breakpoints, which will fire JS callbacks when the browser width crosses said breakpoints.  It also allows for CSS classes to be applied to designated elements which reflect the current breakpoint.  It can be used when you need to do anything in Javascript based on window resizing.  The server-side component is useful if you're using a PHP-based CMS for coordinating breakpoints.

A breakpoint is defined as a single point along the horizontal axis.  To the left lies a breakpoint segment, and to the right of the hightest value breakpoint lies the breakpoint ray.  To the right of all but the highest value breakpoint, likes a breakpoint segment.  See the section below _Breakpoint Theory_.

### Common Mistakes

* By definition a _breakpoint_ does not have a width, nor does it have a minimum or a maximum; it's just a point.
* I've heard people say _breakpoint_ when they actually mean _breakpoint segment_ or _breakpoint ray_.
* A CSS media query represents a _breakpoint segment or ray_ not a _breakpoint_.


## Usage

    // Breakpoints only, using default settings.
    var obj = new BreakpointX(480, 768);
    
    // Breakpoints only with settings.
    var obj = new BreakpointX([480, 768], {
      addClassesTo: 'html',
      classPrefix: 'bpx-',
      resizeThrottle: 200,
      breakpointRayImageWidthRatio: 1.5,
    });
    
    // With named segments.
    var obj = new BreakpointX([480, 768], ['small', 'medium', 'large']);
    
    // Named segments and custom settings.
    var obj = new BreakpointX([480, 768], ['small', 'medium', 'large'], {
      addClassesTo: 'html',
      classPrefix: 'bpx-',
      resizeThrottle: 200,
      breakpointRayImageWidthRatio: 1.5,
    });

### Create a new instance, define breakpoints

    // Register three breakpoints that indicate the following:
    // - breakpoint segment: 0px - 239px
    // - breakpoint segment: 240px - 767px
    // - breakpoint ray: 768px +
    var bp = new BreakpointX([240, 768]);

### Find the breakpoint by a horizontal, x value.

    var alias = bp.alias(240);
    // alias === '(min-width:240px) and (max-width: 767px)';

    var alias = bp.alias(200);
    // alias === 'max-width: 239px';

    var alias = bp.alias(300);
    // alias === '(min-width:240px) and (max-width: 767px)';

    var alias = bp.alias(1080);
    // alias === 'min-width: 768px';

### Register a callback to fire

    // When the window crosses 768 getting smaller
    bp.add('smaller', ['(min-width:240px) and (max-width: 767px)'], function () {
      console.log('Now you\'re in (min-width:240px) and (max-width: 767px)!');
    });

    // When the window crosses 768 getting bigger
    bp.add('bigger', ['(min-width:240px) and (max-width: 767px)'], function () {
      console.log('Now you\'re in (min-width:240px) and (max-width: 767px)!');
    });

    // When the window crosses any breakpoint in either direction
    bp.add('both', bp.aliases, function (from, to, direction) {
      console.log('Now you\'re in: ' + to.name);
      console.log('Window just got ' + direction);
    });

### Alternative: Create a new instance with named segments

When you construct an instance of _BreakpointX_ using only numbers, you simply list the breakpoints and the names are autogenerated.  However, it is possible to name your breakpoint segments and breakpoint ray when you construct _BreakpointX_ by passing an object instead.  The keys of the object are the segment names and the ray name, and the values are the breakpoints with a final value of _Infinity_ to represent the ray.

The following example defines:

* A breakpoint ray named _small_
* A breakpoint at 240px
* A breakpoint segment named _medium_
* A breakpoint at 768px
* A breakpoint ray named _large_

Here is the code:

    var bp = new BreakpointX([{small: 240, medium: 768, large: Infinity}]);

### Add a class to an element reflecting the current breakpoint

    var bp = new BreakpointX([{mobile: 768, desktop: Infinity}], {
      addClassesTo: 'body'
    });

The body element will look like this when the browser gets larger and crosses 768px.

    <body class="bpx-desktop bpx-bigger">

### PHP

For PHP usage the namespace `AKlump\\BreakpointX` should map to _node_modules/@aklump/breakpointx/dist_.  Here's an example for _composer.json_.

    {
        "autoload": {
            "psr-4": {
                "AKlump\\BreakpointX\\": "node_modules/@aklump/breakpointx/dist"
            }
        }
    }
